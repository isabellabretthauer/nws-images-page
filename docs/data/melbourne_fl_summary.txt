...STRONG THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING SOUTH THROUGH THE TREASURE COAST
INTRACOASTAL AND NEARSHORE ATLANTIC WATERS...

The areas affected include...
  Sebastian Inlet to Jupiter Inlet 0-20 nm...

At 325 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated strong thunderstorms, capable
of producing winds to around 30 knots and small hail. These
thunderstorms were located along a line extending from 17 nm
northeast of Sebastian Inlet State Park to Gifford to near Fort
Pierce South, moving south at 20 knots.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Mariners can expect gusty winds to around 30 knots, locally higher
waves, and lightning strikes. Boaters should seek safe harbor
immediately until these storms pass.

These strong thunderstorms will likely produce winds to around 30
knots, and could pose a serious hazard for boaters. A special marine
warning may eventually be required when these strong thunderstorms
reaches the nearshore waters. Boaters should consider heading for
shore before these strong thunderstorms arrives.
