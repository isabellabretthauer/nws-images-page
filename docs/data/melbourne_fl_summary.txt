...GUSTY OUTFLOW FROM STRONG THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MAINLAND
APPROACHING THE WATERS...

The areas affected include...
  Sebastian Inlet to Jupiter Inlet 0-20 nm...

At 420 PM EDT, Doppler radar indicated strong thunderstorms over the
mainland, capable of producing winds to around 30 knots. These
thunderstorms were located over Winter Beach, moving east at 15
knots. Outflow from these storms will push rapidly back to the coast
well ahead of any potential precipitation. This outflow will spread
southward down toward Fort Pierce over the next 30 to 60 minutes.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Mariners can expect gusty winds to around 30 knots, locally higher
waves, and lightning strikes. Boaters should seek safe harbor
immediately until this storm passes.

This strong thunderstorm will likely produce winds to around 30
knots, and lightning strikes, and could pose a serious hazard for
boaters. A special marine warning may eventually be required when
these strong thunderstorms reach the nearshore waters. Boaters
should consider heading for shore before these strong thunderstorms
arrive.
